# Project-3-The-Amazing-Maze

 # Class: CPSC 3120
 # Professor: Brian Malloy
 # Authors: Landon Thomas & Ben Newton

 # This project brings together three computing ideas: 
 # 1. The Union–Find data structure. 
 # 2. The use of SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) to visualize algorithms in real time. 
 # 3. The Model–View–Controller (MVC) architecture to organize code. This creates a Maze like structure that can be increased, solved or configured to users own specifications
